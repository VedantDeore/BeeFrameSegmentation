# Bee Frame Segmentation

The objective of this project was to implement a segmentation model to accurately define and isolate the region of a bee within a frame, removing other elements. This task is essential for further processing and analysis of bee behavior and characteristics, particularly focusing on their eggs and larvae. The dataset used was sourced from the DeepBee project, and the model was evaluated using various performance metrics to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the DeepBee repository, specifically designed for bee segmentation tasks. The images in this dataset are annotated with bounding boxes labeling different elements such as 'eggs' and 'larvae' within the frames.

 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing was a critical part of the project. This step included:

Loading and Splitting the Data: The dataset was split into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Bounding Box Conversion: The bounding box data was formatted to be compatible with the model input requirements.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as random rotation, flipping, and scaling were applied to increase the diversity of the training set, thereby improving the model's robustness.
 Model Implementation
4.1 Model Architecture
A deep learning-based segmentation model was implemented, leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The architecture was chosen for its ability to capture spatial hierarchies and features from the images effectively.

 Training
The model was trained on the preprocessed data, utilizing the training set. Key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs were fine-tuned to optimize the model's performance.

 Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the validation set using metrics including mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1-score. These metrics were selected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the modelâ€™s accuracy and efficiency in detecting and segmenting the bee-related elements within the frames.
